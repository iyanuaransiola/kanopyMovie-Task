                I Am Not Your Negro is a movie adaptation which begins with the author’s return to the U.S. in 1957 after living in France for almost a decade—a return prompted by seeing a photograph of 15-year-old Dorothy Counts and the violent white mob that surrounded her as she entered and desegregated Harding High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. After seeing that picture, Baldwin explained, “I could simply no longer sit around Paris discussing the Algerian and the black American problem. Everybody was paying their dues, and it was time I went home and paid mine.” I Am Not Your Negro chronicles Baldwin’s life through the civil-rights movement, focusing on his personal relationships to Medgar, Malcolm, and Martin.</p>

                I Am Not Your Negro, directed by Raoul Peck (2016). The film will be introduced by Dr. Joe Galbo, Professor, Social Sciences, and you are invited to stay after the screening for the discussion.
